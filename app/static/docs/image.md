### Getting Started with Image Utilities

- **Model**: Select the AI model for image generation. The model defines the algorithm used to interpret your prompt and create the image.
  - `dall-e-2`: Capable of generating creative interpretations of your prompts.
  - `dall-e-3`: Offers higher quality images and additional customization options.

- **Prompt**: Enter a text description in the prompt field. This should be a clear and detailed description of the image you want to generate.
  - **Important Caveat**: Dall-E 3 modifies your prompt input automatically, in an identical fashion to the Chat-GPT Web UI. Keep this in mind.
  
- **Size**: Choose the dimensions for the output image. The size affects the resolution and aspect ratio of the generated image.

- **Quality (DALL-E 3 only)**: If using DALL-E 3, you can select the image quality:
  - `standard`: Generates images with standard definition.
  - `hd`: Produces high-definition images with finer details.

- **Style (DALL-E 3 only)**: Choose the style that influences the artistic direction of the image:
  - `vivid`: Results in more vibrant and stylized images.
  - `natural`: Creates images with a more realistic appearance.

- **Generate**: Click the "Generate" button to submit the form and initiate the image generation process.

### Viewing Generated Images

- After generation, images will appear on the page. Each image will be accompanied by options to download or see in full size.
- The image history displays the 15 most recent images, including thumbnails and details like the prompt, model, size, and creation date.
